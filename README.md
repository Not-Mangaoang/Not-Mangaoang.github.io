### This the most ambitious project in 2023 since they are changing the body of a FERRARI F40! One of the most luxurious and  most sought-after car brands of all time. not only that but the car itself is a masterpiece and has caught the attention of car enthusiasts all around the world. That once hyper-luxurious car has been cut up and turned into a monstrous and thought-provoking car by these Japanese mad lads. Not only that but it is possible for Ferrari to make them unable to purchase another Ferrari again. So, not only is it ambitious, it is also risky since this might be the last project they ever do on a Ferrari.
